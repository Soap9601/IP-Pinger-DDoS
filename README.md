# IP-Pinger-DDoS


-IP pinger a tool or program used to send a small packet of data to a specific IP address to determine if it's reachable and how long it takes for the packet to travel back. This process is known as "pinging." It's commonly 
 used for network troubleshooting to test connectivity between devices on a network or between networks. Pinging can also be used for malicious purposes, such as determining if a target IP address is online or for 
 reconnaissance in preparation for a cyber attack.

- DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service. It's a type of cyber attack where multiple compromised systems, often infected with malware, are used to flood a target system or network with excessive traffic, overwhelming 
 its resources and causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can disrupt services, crash websites, and cause financial losses for organizations. They are typically carried out by botnets, which are 
 networks of compromised devices controlled by a single attacker or group.
